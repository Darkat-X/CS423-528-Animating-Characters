# CS428-Animating-Characters
Part 1
The agent was controlled by WASD, W and S for walk forwards and backwards, A and D for strafe forward and walk left and right. Space is for jumping(3 different types of animation for running, walking and standing) and shift is for running. A/D+W/S is for turning left or right while walking forwards and backwards. Q/E + S for turning on the spot. Z and C for strafing left and right while walking backwards. The agent can jump over the cube obstacle and the sphere obstacle, and has specific idle action.
For the EXTRA part, while the cube hanging in the air is in her sight and she is close enough to the cube, the agent will stay looking at it. And if the footing means the agent can walk foot by foot, not translation, we did that.
Part 2
The camera can be navigated by WASD. Right clicking can select the agent you want and cancel the “selected” by right clicking again. Left clicking can set a destination. After setting a destination, the selected agent will move to the destination automatically. During moving, you can use left/right arrow keys to control the speed of the agent. The current speed will show on the screen with red words. The agent will start to walk or run based on the speed.
Part 3
For part 3, there are 11 agents in a room and they will automatically move to the target by throwing different ways. You can control the camera the same way with Part 2. No other operation needed.
